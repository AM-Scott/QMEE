## WEEK 3 - visualization

# Check for normality on the risiduals**

# to test the assumptions of a model we usually need to fit it first (seems backwards)

# coefficient plots good - shows information about the effect of that parameter

# for making final plot - want to show as much of the real data as possible



# REORDER - sort by mean - reorder(Place, hom_rate) - reorder place by homicide rate

# Bad to have any info about the graph not on the graph itself (e.g. labels)


# Dushoff's lecture

# Anchors (e.g. at 0)

# Scales - log is good for physical quantities

# for visualization, can change the transformation- use log(1+x) rather than log(x)

# Standard errors - not about your data...

# If you have a lot of data points, maybe use violin rather than boxplot
