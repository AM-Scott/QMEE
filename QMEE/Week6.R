## Week 6

## More permutation stuff

# CONFIDENCE INTERVALS - can't have both permutation and confidence intervals 
## PERMUTATION TESTS just say there is "something about the data" as permutation tests make no assumptions about the data or anything else

# to get a confidence interval for the mean - have to assume the data are symmetric

# Advantages and disadvantages

# Nitrogen, phosporous and algae
# Could imagine scrambling N, P, or both
# Scramble the nitrogen - just  tells me that I can't trust what I see about nitrogen (null hypothesis of nitrogen doesn't matter)



## Ben's part of the lecture

# Actually coding the permutation

# ****** other test statistics you can use - linear regression and take the slope

# lmPerm computest the pvalues by permutation
