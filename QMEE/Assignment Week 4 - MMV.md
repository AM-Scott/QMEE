Week 4 assignment 1 - Statistical Philosophy - MMV Question

Part I:
What is the probability that a random person picked from the population has MMV if they test positive?

First, let’s assume there are 1000 people in this population. 

1% of the population = 10 will actually have MMV. 100% of them will test positive. 
5% of the remaining population = 0.05*990 = approximately 50 will not have MMV but will test positive. 

Of the 60 total positive tests, only 10 people actually have MMV. So a random person’s probability of actually having MMV given that they tested positive is only 10/60 or 16.66%. 


Part II:
You learn that your friend has a positive test for MMV. What do you tell them?

First, we need to ask the friend why they got the test in the first place. Is this a standardized test that everyone in the population (or in a specific field of work, for example) is required to get whether they suspect they have MMV or not, or did the friend get the test voluntarily because they might have suspected having MMV? 

If the situation is the former, we can safely assume that they were effectively randomly picked from the population, and their probability of actually having MMV given the positive test is about 17%, and we would say not to worry too much about it. A second test could be problematic because the two tests would not necessarily be independent (e.g. there could be some non-MMV reason that he got the positive test in the first place that would produce a positive test again). Perhaps there is a different type of test that could be done as a second, more independent, piece of evidence. 

If the situation is the latter, their prior probability of having MMV may be higher than the baseline 1% as we have some additional information that could point toward MMV in addition to the positive test. In this case, we would say that their probability of having MMV is higher than the “random-person” 17%, and they should get it checked out and monitored more closely.
