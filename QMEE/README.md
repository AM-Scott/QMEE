Assignment Week 1

The dataset for this assignment is from a project aiming to create artificially selected lineages of fruit flies that are diverged in their level of sociability (which we define as the tendency of animals to engage in non-aggressive group activities). For each generation of selection, we quantify sociability using arenas with 8 compartments, each with a small food patch, that allow groups of 16 flies to assume their most preferred social arrangement after a period of acclimatization. The dependent variable is the “Aggregation Index” (AI), or variance/mean number of flies in each compartment, and varies from 0 (least social arrangement – all flies spread out evenly among the food patches) to 16 (most social arrangement – all flies in a single compartment). We then select flies from the largest group(s) to reproduce for the “Up” selected lineages, and from the smallest groups for the “Down” selected lineages. The main overall goal of this project is to identify genetic variants that may be underpinning some of the phenotypic variation seen in this social trait.

While I have only completed about 1/3rd of the expected required number of generations of selection, I would still like to know if there has been any meaningful divergence in sociability (as measured by the aggregation index) at this point. I would also like to know about the extent of environmental variation in producing variation among generations.
