### Week 10 - Power analysis

### "magic power level" is 80%, some say 50%

power.t.test(n=10, delta =2 , sd = 1)

power.t.test(delta = 2, sd = 1, power = 0.8)

### Mostly want to be solving for power or N with these (not the difference, or the variation)

### Wednesday class - Dushoff returns to vitamin A example

### - simulate proportion of false positives (if there were no effect, 
### and you run the exp 1000 times, how often would you see an effect?)

### All I need to go through with an experiment is the confidence interval (Is my
### true value in the confidence interval, and does my confidence interval overlap 0)

### cvr = coverage - want to know if you succeeded in getting the right answer

### numvec... power curve (look at power as you increase the number of children (N))
