### Week8 - Generalized linear models

### just use log scale when dealing with positive only data

### GLMs invented for data that are awkward to deal with via transforming (e.g. count, proportion data)

### For Gamma - in general it is simpler to just log transform instead

### Overdispersion - variance is larger than would be expected by the distribution
### -> not relevant for Gamma, Gaussian, etc (only when the variance is assumed from the mean?)

### parameter interpretation
### to get p values has to use infinite degrees of freedom
### interpretate it on the effect scale rather than the data scale itself

### Use chisq (in drop1) for models that DO NOT have a separate variance parameter, use F otherwise
