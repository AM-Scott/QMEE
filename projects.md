Generating fruit fly populations with divergent sociability

The dataset for the final project would from a project aiming to create artificially selected lineages of fruit flies that are diverged in their level of sociability (the tendency of animals to engage in non-aggressive group activities).
  I wish to determine whether there has been phenotypic divergence among the 2 artificial selection treatments over 10+ generations of selection (meaning the "Up" treatment has higher sociability than the "Down", but this difference increases over generations). Further, I want to investigate whether this divergence is being driven by only a few of the replicate lineages for each selection treatment, or if it is a consequence of divergence among all 4 replicates. There are some smaller questions I wish to look at: e.g. how sociability is affected by general lab adaptation, and whether there are interesting variable responses to our selection regime between the sexes.
  Some of the above analyses have been completed as part of the homework assignments. Overall, the more interesting (and intensive) analysis will come with the genomics data that will be generated at the end of the selection experiment, and part of the project for this course could be to get some experience analyzing those kinds of data by obtaining some from another source. 
  Since the data for this project are relatively incomplete, I would not mind being paired with someone that has a complete data set with more complex analyses to be done at this time.
